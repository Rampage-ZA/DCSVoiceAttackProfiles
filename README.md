# DCSVoiceAttackProfiles

This profile can be imported into VoiceAttack for use with the Tomcat / Jester.
It's a stripped down and simplified version of Bailey's F14 Voice Attack profile with customizations of my own.

Note that this profile will require you to have matching keybinds for the required commands in DCS to function correctly.
